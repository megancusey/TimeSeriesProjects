## Chapter 8 Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 5.

## 1. Figure 8.31 shows the ACFs for 36 random numbers,
## 360 random numbers and 1,000 random numbers.

## a. Explain the differences amoung these figures. Do
## they all indicate that the data are white noise?

## b. Why are the critical values at differrent distances
## from the mean of zero? Why are the autocorrelations 
## different in each figure when they each refer to white 
## noise?

## 2. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the 
## daily closing IBM stock price series (data set ibmclose).
## Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock
## and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows the series
## is non-stationary and should be differenced.

## 3. For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox
## transformation and order of differencing in order to obtain
## stationary data.

## a. usnetelec
## b. usgdp
## c. mcopper
## d. enplanements
## e. visitors

## 5. For your retail data (from Exercise 3 in Section 2.10), find
## the appropriate order of differencing (after transformation if
## necessary) to obtain stationary data.
